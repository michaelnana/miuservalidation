Getting Started

This is an assignment that takes a username and password and adds it to a db if they are both valid.
For a live demo, go to <a href="https://miuseraccess.herokuapp.com/">https://miuseraccess.herokuapp.com/</a> to see this in action.
If you want to run this locally, make sure you have activator 1.3.12 installed and simple run activator run in the project root.
Have fun!
